# AlphaB
A webapp to learn alphabet of different languages.

Core feature I want:
- [ ] Having alphabet from different language
- [ ] Pronunciation when tap on a letter
- [ ] Having a modern UI/UX look
- [ ] Responsive app to support a wide range of screen
- [ ] Implement web accessibility
- [ ] Be opensource and allow people to contribute

Cool future feature:
- [ ] Flash card to learn
- [ ] Allow user to save progressions

Dont hesitate to make Issue/PR, I'd be happy to get your opinions and tips on how to improve the project.

> [!WARNING] 
> The project is in the early stages, and I haven't chosen which license I will use for it.
